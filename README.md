# MyScript Interactive Ink Samples

Interactive Ink SDK is the best way to integrate handwriting recognition capabilities into your Android application. Interactive Ink extends digital ink to allow users to more intuitively create, interact with, and share content in digital form. Handwritten text, mathematical equations or even diagrams are interpreted in real-time to be editable via simple gestures, responsive and easy to convert to a neat output.

You can find two examples that help you starting with Interactive Ink SDK on [MyScript Developer Portal](https://developer.myscript.com/docs/interactive-ink/latest/android/).

This repository comes in addition with further advanced Android examples that developers using Interactive Ink SDK can reuse inside their projects or from which they could draw inspiration.

## Installation

1. Clone the examples repository `git clone https://github.com/MyScript/iink_sdk-additional-examples-android.git`.

2. If you already have a certificate go to next step, else claim to receive the free license to start develop your application by following the first steps of [Getting Started](https://developer.myscript.com/getting-started).

3. Copy this certificate to `certificate/src/main/java/com/myscript/certificate/MyCertificate.java`

4. Open `java` folder in Android Studio.

## Various examples

This repository provides you with an additional set of ready-to-use examples based on Android:

1. The batch mode sample is an example of how to integrate iink SDK off-screen, without any user interface. It consists in batch processing content, i.e. processing a series of pointer events corresponding to already collected ink strokes and exporting the recognition result. It comes with four pointer events samples that correspond to four different content types "Text", "Math", "Diagram", "Raw Content". When starting the app a dialog will be displayed to choose which type of part you want to proceed. By default those content types are exported in respectively .txt, LaTeX, svg and JIIX formats, but you can choose to export in png by modifying the following line in the MainActivity class:

~~~#!java
    // this is the function where we process exteranl output and export it
    // add true if you want to export in png
    offScreenProcess(typeOfPart[it])
~~~

</div>

NB: you will retrieve data converted in your device internal storage: `Android/data/com.myscript.iink.samples.batchmode/files`

2. The exercise assessment illustrates the case when you want to use several writing areas each one for a specific purpose in your application. It is thus using multiple editors, one per writing area, as each one has a different purpose:
- First one is dedicated to "Math" content types
- Second one is dedicated to "Math" content types but with a user defined grammar which is dynamically loaded at start.
- Third one is dedicated to "Text" content types
- Fourth one is dedicated to "Diagram" content types
- Fifth one is dedicated to "Draw" content types

3. The search example shows how to perform word search on raw digital ink and highlights the result found in the ink. it is based on "Raw Content" Content Type by default but you can change it to "Text Document" by modifying the following line in the MainActivity class:

~~~#!java
  // wait for view size initialization before setting part
        editorView!!.post(Runnable() {
            val partType = "Raw Content" // change to "Text Document" if you want to test
~~~
<div align="center">
 <img src="search-sample.gif" alt="search sample" width="302">
</div>

4. The write to type example gives you a hint how to implement Scribble like feature relying on the Recognizer API of iink SDK. It is based on a contextless gesture recognition combined with a text recognition.
To run both recognitions simultaneously, two instances of Recognizer are created - one for Gesture recognition and the other one for Text recognition:
~~~#!java
    static final float INCH_IN_MILLIMETER = 25.4f;

    float scaleX = INCH_IN_MILLIMETER / displayMetrics.xdpi;
    float scaleY = INCH_IN_MILLIMETER / displayMetrics.ydpi;

    Recognizer textRecognizer = engine.createRecognizer(scaleX, scaleY, "Text");
    Recognizer gestureRecognizer = engine.createRecognizer(scaleX, scaleY, "Gesture");
~~~

<div align="center">
 <img src="write-to-type.gif" alt="write to type sample" width="302">
</div>

NB: the Recognizer API is available from iink SDK 2.1.
